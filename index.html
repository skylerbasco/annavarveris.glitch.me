        Education in Latin America
      </h2>
      <p>
        Latin America as we know it today has its roots in colonization. 
        In the political turmoil, social and economic inequalities, environmental insecurity, the consequences of this practice remain.  
        
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Although Latin America has shifted towards democracy, the inequalities between the wealthy and poor are very apparent in its education system.

      <h1 class="title">About</h1>
      <p>
Growing up in a Greek-Dominican household, I have
always been open to learning new perspectives and
different cultural experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
International Relations, with an interest in Environmental
Policy. I have taken coursework in conflict resolution,
political economy, and international law. Alongside my
degree, I hope to build a better tomorrow through the
efforts of diplomacy and advocacy of global issues.
<br/>
<br/>
At Adelphi University, I am part of the Levermore Global
Scholars Program, an "academic community dedicated
to preparing students to become global thinkers and
leaders in a changing world." Additionally, I am part of
the Environment Action Coalition, Latino Students
Association and the International Students Society to
further expand my knowledge on global and regional
issues.
